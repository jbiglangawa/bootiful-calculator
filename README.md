# Bootiful Calculator | SwingSpringer entry
## ðŸ¥ˆ ðŸŽŠ 2nd place ðŸŽŠ ðŸ¥ˆ
This is my first attempt at Spring Boot and Integration testing. Fortunately I won 2nd place! Very happy with the results since I'm against many people knowledgeable in Java

Entry for the [Shaunwild97's](https://github.com/Shaunwild97/CodingChallenges/tree/master/bootiful-calculator) Coding challenge from the Java Discord server. I recommend to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the workspace. The project is built using Spring Boot version 2.4.3 and Java version 1.8.0_261, but any version of Java 8 and above will work.

This project is hosted on [https://bootiful-calculator.herokuapp.com](https://bootiful-calculator.herokuapp.com/). Hook up your favorite REST Client and test the requests! Note that heroku instances falls asleep after minutes of inactivity so be notified that your first request might take time!

To run the project locally, clone or fork it. Open the project in VS Code and run in Spring Boot Dashboard. Afterwards, access it via **http://localhost:8080/calculate** on your favorite REST Client. The workspace recommends [REST Client Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) for VS Code that you can use once installed.
